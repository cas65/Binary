## 2. Binary Numbers

### What are Binary Numbers?
Binary numbers are used by almost all modern computers and digital systems because they’re easy to work with using digital electronics. Each binary digit (bit) is either 0 (off) or 1 (on), which match the two states of an electronic circuit: off and on. These states line up directly with electrical signals, where voltage is either present or absent.

### How Binary Works
In binary, each digit represents a power of **2**. Just like decimal numbers have place values based on powers of 10, binary numbers have place values based on powers of 2. For example:

- The rightmost digit represents **2⁰** (1),
- The next digit represents **2¹** (2),
- The next represents **2²** (4),
- The next represents **2³** (8), and so on.

Each digit in a binary number shows whether that power of 2 is part of the total sum (1) or not (0).

### Example: Convert Binary to Decimal

Let's convert the binary number 1101 to decimal:

#### Step-by-Step Conversion:
- The binary number 1101 represents:
  - The rightmost 1 is in the **1’s place** (2⁰).
  - The next 0 is in the **2’s place** (2¹),
  - The next 1 is in the **4’s place** (2²),
  - The leftmost 1 is in the **8’s place** (2³),

So, the binary number 1101 is calculated as:

1 × 2³ + 1 × 2² + 0 × 2¹ + 1 × 2⁰
= 8 + 4 + 0 + 1
= 13
