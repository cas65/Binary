## 2. Binary Numbers

### What are Binary Numbers?
Binary numbers are used by nearly all modern computers and digital systems because they are simple to implement with digital electronic circuitry. Each binary digit (bit) is either 0 (off) or 1 (on), representing the two possible states of an electronic circuit: **off** and **on**. These states correspond directly to electrical signals such as voltage being either present or absent.

### How Binary Works
In binary, each digit represents a power of **2**. Just like decimal numbers have place values based on powers of 10, binary numbers have place values based on powers of 2. For example:

- The rightmost digit represents **2⁰** (1),
- The next digit represents **2¹** (2),
- The next represents **2²** (4),
- The next represents **2³** (8), and so on.

Each digit in a binary number corresponds to whether that power of 2 is included in the total sum (represented by 1) or excluded (represented by 0).

### Example: Convert Binary to Decimal

Let's convert the binary number 1101 to decimal:

#### Step-by-Step Conversion:
- The binary number 1101 represents:
  - The rightmost 1 is in the **1’s place** (2⁰).
  - The next 0 is in the **2’s place** (2¹),
  - The next 1 is in the **4’s place** (2²),
  - The leftmost 1 is in the **8’s place** (2³),

So, the binary number 1101 is calculated as:

1 × 2³ + 1 × 2² + 0 × 2¹ + 1 × 2⁰
= 8 + 4 + 0 + 1
= 13

### Practice Exercise

Now, try converting the following binary numbers to decimal. Use the method from the tutorial to convert them step by step:

1. 1011
2. 1100
3. 10001
4. 0111
5. 11100








#### Answers:
1. 1011 → **11** (decimal)
2. 1100 → **12** (decimal)
3. 10001 → **17** (decimal)
4. 0111 → **7** (decimal)
5. 11100 → **28** (decimal)
